Welcome to our text-based version of Scrabble! If you are unfamiliar with the
rules of Scrabble, we have attached a link to the official rules below. The
different game commands included below describe how to perform different actions
throughout the game. The winner is the player with the highest score at the end
of the game!

The board is a grid whose rows are represented by letters in alphabetical order
going downward and whose columns are represented by numbers that increase going
to the right, starting at 0. An individual cell is represented by a combination
of a letter and a number. For example, "A0" represents the top left corner of
the board.
