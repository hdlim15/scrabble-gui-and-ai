- OCaml Graphics
  - type 'ocamlfind query graphics' into your terminal
    - if a path is returned, you're good to go!
    - if you receive a 'Package "graphics" not found' error, that means you need
      to keep reading this setup document.
  - to install the OCaml Graphics module, ensure you have Homebrew on your Mac.
  - Run 'brew install ocaml'
  - If the above test still failes, type 'brew reinstall ocaml'
